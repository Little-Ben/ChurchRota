- created links in GPL license file (html)

Important:
- please check your "Church Rota Behaviour" settings for

      with this update it is set "disabled"
  + Snapshot - show only skills up to user's max. used skill group
      it was mistakenly set "disabled" by download zip of V2.2.0,
	  update procedure is now correct, so if you have not installed
	  V2.2.0 zip this is not relevant for you


internal stuff:
- new function: isBandAdmin
- snapshot: code cosmetics (apostrophs for querying database rows)
- editSkills: special treatment for skillgroup=2 (band), 
  group cannot be deleted anymore,
  it is used as a special group throughout the code 
  (due to the band members)

- notify system admin via mail when updating database

new functionalities (and corresponding options in settings):
- optional sorting events in descending order (only index.php)
- optional also show snapshot button for users
- configurable language locales and formats for date/time 
- Rota Overview mail (for a whole month)
  + new flag for users "is Overview Recipient" (in user management)

  + preview page (with editing posibility)
- Google calender export per event in snapshot (via URL)
  + if logged in as normal user: only date, time, event type, location
  + if logged in as admin user: same as user plus leader/preacher/band 
    infos
  + utf8-wrapper (for URL-encoding)
  + field for Google Group Calendar ID (settings)
  + Time Zone
- optional reduce events to "show my events" direct after users login
- optional reduce snapshot to max defined skill group of logged in user 
  (not logged in => group 1), 
  so the more sensitive a skill group should be, the higher set its skill 
  group, example: 
    + band and host infos for not logged in users - group 1)
    + leading info should require group 2 (including infos of group 1)
    + preacher info only for users with group 3 rights 
      (including groups 1+2)
    + always all infos for admin users
    -> a user with a skill defined for skill group 2 
         * can see band, host and leading 
         * but can not see preaching
- optional only show actual month in snapshot,
  also shows events of following month if actual day > 20 
  ("TwoMonthView") 
- "array_combine" backport

changes "behind the scenes":

- configurable mail subject, now introduced in overview mail: 
  subject pattern needs to be in the first line of mail template,
  surrounded by {{ }} - example: 
     {{configurable subject}}
     rest of 
     mail message 
  future development: include this feature to all mail templates
- handling of password changing was broken (url post parameters)
- repaired link for deleting a skill (editSkills.php)
- removed file \graphics\design\maindesign.psd,
  it was propably a design study and is not needed in running system,
  deleted because of size (can be found in rev 7-15 of svn trunk)
- removing admin flag of an user, does not remove own admin rights
- subject of "New user mail" now includes new user's name
